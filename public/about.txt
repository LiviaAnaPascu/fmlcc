fml.cc is creating a new open space in vienna. a bold step towards demolishing the dominant masculine cycling environment and challenging preexisting norms and biases that have long excluded or marginalized women. by offering group rides, workshops, and an open platform for discussion and collaboration, fml.cc aims to build a community deeply rooted in shared values, experiences, and passion for cycling.
one of the core missions of fml.cc is to harness the often-underestimated power of female road rage.
instead of letting frustration and anger be built up, the collective encourages women to bundle these emotions into a powerful force for change. by redirecting this energy, fml.cc aims to foster resilience, determination, and solidarity among its members. the collective is not just about riding bikes; it's about creating a supportive and empowering network where women can connect, inspire each other, and grow together. fml.cc recognises the unique challenges women face in the male-dominated sport and seeks to provide a space where they can be heard and seen â€“ together we ride, thrive and conquer.
